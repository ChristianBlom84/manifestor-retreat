          <h3>Being a Manifestor (woman) in relationships</h3>
          <p>
            Being a Manifestor woman in relationships can be a challenging
            experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have a closed Aura, and we don&apos;t interact the same as the
            rest of them. Love is always an issue, and with all the social
            conditioning around men and women, and what it means to be a
            daughter, a wife, a mother, it may seem sometimes like it just
            doesnâ€™t work for us.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the retreat we will discuss this super important topic and see
            how we can take the relationships in our life to the next level, out
            of correctness.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yes, you have to initiate. And this is where the dance of everyday
            life comes into play and there can be space to explore what works
            for your relationships! How to respect yourself and the others -
            your partner, children, colleagues and friends.

          <h3>
            Personal Authority - the beautiful differences in our Inner
            Authority
          </h3>
          <p>
            Even though we are all Manifestors here, living in the same type of
            energy field, Aura, we all navigate life very differently, according
            to centers, channels, circuity, profile and more.
          </p>
          <p>
            The main difference between us, and the main sameness on the other
            hand, is inner authority. Emotional, Splenic or Ego - we each have a
            certain way of moving in the world, a distinct power to our
            manifesting, a special pace.
          </p>
          <p>
            Inner authority comes before strategy for us Manifestors. It is the
            most important. We wait for the universe to push us, through our
            inner authority, that&apos;s the mechanics of correctness for us.
          </p>
          <p>
            Understanding our inner authority is crucial. Connecting with it
            deeply is what brings peace to our lives. So in the retreat we will
            learn about the different authorities, discuss them, and investigate
            them together.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will work in groups according to the different authorities, and
            experiment difference and sameness.

          <h3>A deep dive into Informing</h3>
          <p>
            Informing - what does it mean? How do you do it? Will it look the
            same for everyone? Why does it feel so awkward sometimes?
          </p>
          <p>
            Informing is an art. It is the way we build the bridge across this
            closeness of ours, and it&apos;s not necessarily a natural thing for
            us. But it&apos;s our strategy, and it works.
          </p>
          <p>
            Correct informing goes hand in hand with inspiration. It is actually
            initiation itself, our power going from a motor to the throat,
            expressing our inner form and manifesting as a new formation
            outside.
          </p>
          <p>
            When we are anchored in the form, connected deeply to inner
            authority and to our spirit, informing becomes a beautiful process
            of inner knowing, and a whole new way of communicating in resonance
            to what we truly are as beings.
          </p>
          <p>We manifest with words.</p>
          <p>
            In the retreat we will dive deeply into the concept and truth of
            informing, and experiment with it together, until we OWN it in a
            deeper sense.

            className="w-2/3 sm:w-3/4 md:w-full m-auto"
            src={impact}
            alt=""
          />
          <h3>Impact</h3>
          <p>
            Impact is our very nature.
            <br /> It is our <b>aura</b>, our <b>communication</b>, and our{' '}
            <b>self-knowing</b>.<br />
            By the mechanics of our aura, the way our actions and words meet the
            world, out of a throat connected to a motor, with no sacral to pull
            it back, creates impact
          </p>
          <p>
            This means our very <b>communication</b> with everyone is based upon
            impact. Regardless of our relation to the person, our thoughts or
            feeling for them, or their role in our life. That&apos;s really
            something to ponder - we impact everyone around us all the time,
            whether we like it or not, want it or not. No choice.
          </p>
          <p>
            The mechanics of impact is energy going out from within us,
            &quot;hitting&quot; someone or something on the outside and coming
            back to us. Kind of like an Australian boomerang. When it hits us
            back, it <b>tells us of ourselves</b>, because at the most basic
            energy level - we are our impact!
          </p>
          <p>
            Metaphorically it&apos;s like a dolphin or a whale, using voice as
            sonar - it goes out into the world and comes back creating a picture
            of what it hit around it. It is our frequency coming back. That is
            why our question is &quot;what is my impact?&quot;.
          </p>
          <p>
            Impact is our spiritual path, as well as our service to the world
            when our form is correct and our spirit in it aligned. When we wait
            for the Universe to push us, out of inner authority, our impact
            carries the inspiration of the source to the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            BUT when incorrect, our impact, reflecting our inner frequency, is a
            source of suffering. In our retreat we will experiment and
            investigate together to meet our impact experientially. We will
            reach a deeper understanding on how to make impact more conscious,
            how to impact out of inspiration, and how to know our SELF
            intimately and authentically through impact.

          />
          <h3>Manifesting and Projected Channels</h3>
          <p>
            Manifestors by definition are a motor connected to the throat, with
            no Sacral in the way of the energy to manifest.
          </p>
          <p>
            The motor can be Solar plexus, Ego heart, or Root. It can be one
            motor or more. They can be connected directly to the throat via one
            of the Manifesting channels (21\45, 22\12, 35\36), or be connected
            indirectly through other centers, via Projected channels.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Ego can go through the G-center (21\25) to the throat, through
            the spleen (26\44) to the throat or even spleen to the G to the
            throat. The root can only be connected to the throat through the
            spleen (or spleen to G to throat). So it can be a long way for that
            manifestation energy!
          </p>
          <p>
            What does it mean to have a direct connection, vs. a longer indirect
            one?
            <br />
            What happens when the energy moves through another center on its
            way?
            <br />
            What is it like to manifest through projected channels?
          </p>
          <p>
            We&apos;ll discuss and investigate the different kinds of
            Manifestation to understand our energy better, relax deeper into who
            we are, accept, embrace and love our manifesting, just as it is.

            src={angerTransformation}
            alt=""
          />
          <h3>Anger and transformation</h3>
          <p>
            We call it &quot;the NOT SELF theme&quot;, we all have to deal with
            it, but anger is an inherent part of our nature. It&apos;s no
            mistake.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before any angry thought, or psychology of relations, anger (I
            actually prefer RAGE) is a natural energetic occurrence of our
            mechanics. It is the physical reaction in our Aura to incorrectness,
            usually in the form of a different aura approaching us and cutting
            off the yang &quot;designed to do&quot; silence or movement. In
            that, it is a significant signpost for us. But it&apos;s not only
            that.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rage is a powerful force. In the past it&apos;s what made us kings
            and queens and creators of cultures, but what part does it play
            today?
          </p>
          <p>
            This part of our DNA, if dealt with correctly and lovingly, can be
            the food for transformation, it can change the form, when elevated
            upon to justice, which is its true core.
          </p>
          <p>
            Courage is at the core of us. Rage is its heart (coeur in French).
            Manifestor fire burns on the heart rage, the passion of justice. We
            are warriors. But we can become warriors of love, warriors of SELF.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the retreat we will look at anger and at dealing with it from a
            new perspective. Transforming it and transforming us.

          <h3>Peace and flow</h3>
          <p>
            Signature is the basic energetic natural resonance, existing prior
            to anything else appearing as realty. It is our stamp, our energetic
            fingerprint.
          </p>
          <p>
            So what is peace? On what and how many levels does it occur? How do
            we recognize it? What does it look like and feel like?
          </p>
          <p>
            The retreat is a perfect opportunity to give time and thought for
            this oh so important theme of ours. To ponder it together and
            experiment with it, at all time. To notice it, appreciate it,
            empower it!
          </p>
          <p>
            Here is a question to ponder upon until we meet:
            <br />
            What&apos;s our experience and how does that differ from when we
            started experimenting?
          </p>

          <h3>Conscious vs Unconscious Manifestors</h3>
          <p>
            We each have two charts, the red and the black. The body (design)
            and the personality. Unconscious and Conscious (meaning that which
            is not available to the thought and that which is). We are a whole
            greater than our parts.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Personality is what we think we think we are, it&apos;s how we
            see and experience ourselves, and it may be very different than what
            we are as a whole being. What we perceive may also be very different
            than what others experience of us, the way they see us.
          </p>
          <p>
            What type is your black chart?
            <br />
            Do you &quot;know&quot; you are a Manifestor?
            <br />
            Or maybe you &quot;think&quot; you are a Projecter or Reflector?
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            In the retreat we will discuss the differences between being a
            conscious Manifestor or an unconscious, and understand how it
            affects our life, and what we can &quot;do&quot; about it.
